# Revenue-Trends-Product-Performance-Dashboard

## 📖 Executive Summary
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data, designed to support strategic decision making.  
By combining SQL for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, the dashboard transforms raw data into actionable insights that highlight revenue trends, product performance, customer loyalty, and regional dynamics.  

The objective is to demonstrate how data storytelling can bridge the gap between analytics and business strategy enabling companies to act decisively on evidence rather than assumptions.

## 🗂 Project Scope
This project involves:
- Developing an **interactive sales dashboard** to monitor KPIs such as revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).  
- Conducting **sales trend analysis** to identify growth and decline periods.  
- Evaluating **product performance** to uncover concentration risks and opportunities for diversification.  
- Assessing the **loyalty program’s impact** on customer retention and spending behavior.  
- Comparing **regional performance** to guide market‑specific strategies.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Sales peaked in Dec 2020** ($1.25M revenue, 4,019 orders) but declined for 21 consecutive months, reaching a low of $178K in Oct 2022.  
- **85% of orders** came from three products (Gaming Monitor, AirPods, Samsung Charging Cable Pack), creating dependency risk.  
- **Loyalty members** contributed 55% of revenue in 2022, spending $35 more per order than non‑members.  
- **North America** remains the largest market (55% revenue share, highest AOV at $242), while EMEA showed late‑year growth.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Diversify product portfolio beyond the top three items to reduce dependency.  
- Expand accessory lines (Apple/Samsung) to capture upsell opportunities.  
- Re‑market iPhones to existing Apple customers to boost adoption.  
- Re‑evaluate underperforming products (e.g., Bose SoundSport Headphones) with targeted promotions or discontinuation.  
- Strengthen loyalty program marketing to convert non‑members and increase repeat purchases.
